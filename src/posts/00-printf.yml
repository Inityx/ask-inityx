title: How does <pre>printf()</pre> work in C/++?
content:
  - "<pre>printf()</pre> is part of a family of IO functions in the C
    Standard IO library <pre>stdio.h</pre>. <pre>printf()</pre> is so named
    because it is responsible for printing formatted strings to the default output:
    a virtual file called <pre>stdout</pre>."
  - '<pre>printf()</pre> does not do any of the printing itself; it formats
    the string according to its arguments, and invokes a <pre>write()</pre>
    system call with the newly formatted string as an argument.'
  - "<pre>stdin</pre> and <pre>stdout</pre> operate as virtual files; they
    do not have real locations on the file system, and even though they are
    represented by the file descriptors <pre>0</pre> and <pre>1</pre> in
    programs, they are set to different values inside the kernel. When a program
    runs from a terminal, that program's <pre>stdout</pre> and <pre>stdin</pre>
    are set in the kernel to be the same virtual files that the terminal
    uses for input and output. The terminal continuously reads from the file as
    the program writes to it; this also allows multiple processes to output to the
    same terminal all at once."
  - '<pre>printf(string)</pre> is equivalent to <pre>fprintf(stdout,
    string)</pre>.  You may also manually make the <pre>write()</pre> system
    call using the File Control library <pre>fcntl.h</pre>, but it is far more
    convenient to just use <pre>stdio</pre>.'
  - "Output redirection works by assigning the program's output to a real file
    rather than the virtual one connected to the terminal, wheras piping sets
    up a virtual file between two processes."
