title: What's the deal with Hex notation?
content:
    - Hexadecimal numbers are written with the digits
      <code>0123456789ABCDEF</code>. The format of <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>
      (<code>0x</code> signifying the start of a hex number) is standardized, and is
      one of the
      <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal">C/++ Integer
      Literal</a> formats.
    - Hexadecimal is often used in Computer Science because of its easy
      conversion to Binary; each hexidecimal digit corresponds to half a
      byte. <code>0xC2</code> equals <code>0b1100'0010</code>.
