title: What's the deal with Hex notation?
content:
    - Hexadecimal numbers are written with the digits
      <pre>0123456789ABCDEF</pre>. The format of <pre>0xFFFFFFFF</pre>
      (<pre>0x</pre> signifying the start of a hex number) is standardized, and is
      one of the
      <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal">C/++ Integer
      Literal</a> formats.
    - Hexadecimal is often used in Computer Science because of its easy
      conversion to Binary; each hexidecimal digit corresponds to half a
      byte. <pre>0xC2</pre> equals <pre>0b1100'0010</pre>.
