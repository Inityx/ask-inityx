title: What's the difference between a <mark>&lt;div&gt;</mark> and a <mark>&lt;span&gt;</mark>?

    The effective difference between <mark>&lt;div&gt;</mark> and
    <mark>&lt;span&gt;</mark> is how they are styled by default. When you
    fire up an HTML document in your browser with no CSS, the browser applies a
    'default stylesheet'. Each type of tag in the HTML standard gets its own style
    predefined.

    <mark>&lt;div&gt;</mark> has the CSS <mark>display: block;</mark> by
    default, whereas <mark>&lt;span&gt;</mark> is typically not styled and
    falls back to <mark>display: inline;</mark>. HTML elements with the display
    type <mark>block</mark> will start a new 'row' in the document layout, while
    <mark>inline</mark> elements will be placed inline with the previous and next
    elements.

    This means that the intended use cases for <mark>&lt;div&gt;</mark> and
    <mark>&lt;span&gt;</mark> are page structure and text styling,
    respectively. Because of the cascading nature of CSS, you can technically make
    them do whatever you want, but it's always best to follow a convention if
    you're able to.
