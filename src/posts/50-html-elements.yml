title: What's the difference between a <pre>&lt;div&gt;</pre> and a <pre>&lt;span&gt;</pre>?
content:
    - "The effective difference between <pre>&lt;div&gt;</pre> and
      <pre>&lt;span&gt;</pre> is how they are styled by default. When you
      fire up an HTML document in your browser with no CSS, the browser applies a
      'default stylesheet'. Each type of tag in the HTML standard gets its own style
      predefined."
    - "<pre>&lt;div&gt;</pre> has the CSS <pre>display: block;</pre> by
      default, whereas <pre>&lt;span&gt;</pre> is typically not styled and
      falls back to <pre>display: inline;</pre>. HTML elements with the display
      type <pre>block</pre> will start a new 'row' in the document layout, while
      <pre>inline</pre> elements will be placed inline with the previous and next
      elements."
    - "This means that the intended use cases for <pre>&lt;div&gt;</pre> and
      <pre>&lt;span&gt;</pre> are page structure and text styling,
      respectively. Because of the cascading nature of CSS, you can technically make
      them do whatever you want, but it's always best to follow a convention if
      you're able to."
